# Nexus

Nexus is a cross-platform 2D and 3D graphics and audio library, encompassing a Render Hardware Interface (RHI) across OpenGL, Vulkan and D3D12 and various utilities to support resource loading. It provides a clean and simple abstraction layer across all supported API's while still providing low level control and optimization opportunities for performance-critical applications.

-  Automatic layout and barrier management (toggleable per command list)
-  Support for graphics, meshlet, and compute pipelines
-  Extension/version handling for OpenGL and Vulkan based on driver capabilities
-  Integrated custom ImGui backend implementation
-  Intuitive API design with low-level access preserved:
